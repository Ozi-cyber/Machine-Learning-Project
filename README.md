Figures 1 and 2 show the actual values plotted against the prediction of the four models for macroeconomic variable group and technical indicator variable group, respectively. It is evident in the graph that the technical indicator variable group exhibits better performance than the macroeconomic variable group in predicting gold price, as can be seen on the compactness or the distance between the predicted values of the algorithms against the actual values.

The comparison of the model's prediction in macroeconomics indicator shows that ANN has the lowest performance metrics among other models. This indicates that the ANN has the best performance on predicting the closest to the actual gold rate prices. On the other hand, Linear Regression has the highest performance metrics. 

As for the technical indicators, the comparison of the models' prediction shows that ANN has the lowest metrics. In contrast, Gradient Boosting has the highest metrics. This indicates that ANN has the best predictive model among the other algorithms.
