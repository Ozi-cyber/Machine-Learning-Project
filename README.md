GOLD PRICE PREDICTION: COMPARISON OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES AND TECHNICAL INDICATORS USING REGRESSION ALGORITHMS

  Gold is extremely important in the economy of one's country.  Given its scarcity, investors treat it as a safe haven investment where it is a hedge against market losses and provides protection against price instability. It is an essential component in diversifying the financial reserves  of nations and investors. Utilizing machine learning in gold price prediction is essential to help investors make data-driven decisions. This study compares 4 machine learning algorithms which are Random Forest Regression, Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gradient Boosting to determine whether a set of indicators, either macroeconomic or technical indicators, is more accurate in predicting gold prices

  Figures 1 and 2 show the actual values plotted against the prediction of the four models for macroeconomic variable group and technical indicator variable group, respectively. It is evident in the graph that the technical indicator variable group exhibits better performance than the macroeconomic variable group in predicting gold price, as can be seen on the compactness or the distance between the predicted values of the algorithms against the actual values.

  The comparison of the model's prediction in macroeconomics indicator shows that ANN has the lowest performance metrics among other models. This indicates that the ANN has the best performance on predicting the closest to the actual gold rate prices. On the other hand, Linear Regression has the highest performance metrics. 

  As for the technical indicators, the comparison of the models' prediction shows that ANN has the lowest metrics. In contrast, Gradient Boosting has the highest metrics. This indicates that ANN has the best predictive model among the other algorithms.
